## Summarization üëÄ
Daniel Zavala-Araiza grew up in Mexico City, where severe air pollution once made the air visibly thick. Thanks to strong environmental policies and data-driven decisions, the city drastically improved its air quality, becoming a global example in urban climate action.

Inspired by this transformation, Daniel pursued chemical engineering and later focused on methane emissions‚Äîone of the most potent greenhouse gases. Although methane is emitted in smaller amounts than CO2, it traps much more heat in the short term, making it critical to address.

He now works in Europe, supporting the EU's efforts to reduce methane emissions globally, not just within its borders. New satellite technology like MethaneSat can now detect leaks worldwide, helping ensure compliance with new methane regulations.

The EU‚Äôs policy could become a blueprint for other regions, with countries like Japan and South Korea already following suit. Over 50 major oil and gas companies have committed to cutting methane emissions by 90% by 2030.

Daniel believes that using transparent, real-time data can hold polluters accountable‚Äîand make real change. His work gives him hope, especially as a father, that the future can be shaped by urgent, smart climate action.
