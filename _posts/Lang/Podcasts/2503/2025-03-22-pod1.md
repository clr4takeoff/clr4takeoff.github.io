## Sentences ✍️

1. Humility, not really my **strong suit**.
    - `strong suit` : Strength (an area where someone excels or is particularly skilled)
    - New sentence: Computer Science isn’t my strong suit.

 
2. You’re really struggling to communicate, like **see eye to eye** with another person or even listen to them.
    - `see eye to eye` : To have the same perspective or agree (to share the same opinion or understanding)
    - New sentence: We don’t see eye to eye on this.

 
3. It’s really easy in academia to hide behind **jargon**, hide behind, you know, complex ways of saying simple things.
    - `jargon` : Technical terminology (specialized words used within a specific field, often hard for outsiders to understand)
    - New sentence: The teacher’s jargon confuses me.

 
4. Say you’re asked a question and and you’re not sure, like don’t **derogate** the question or be like, how could anyone ever know.
    - `derogate` : To belittle (to diminish the value of something or criticize it)
    - New sentence: Don’t derogate my question.

 
5. And all this **culminates** in earning higher grades.
    - `culminates` : Reaches a climax (arrives at the highest point or final outcome)
    - New sentence: Studying culminates in good grades.

## 1-min Speech Script 🗣️

I enjoyed this podcast a lot, and it made me rethink team project struggles.

It reminded me that collaboration is more about mindset than just skill.

Debugging isn’t my **strong suit**, so I often miss bugs.

That used to frustrate me, but now I see it as part of the learning process.

That’s where intellectual humility helps, especially since we don’t **see eye to eye** on team projects, which turn messy.

Accepting that others think differently has actually made things smoother.

Tech **jargon** confuses me too, but I shouldn’t **derogate** others’ ideas.

Hard work **culminates** in better results, while rigidity ruins good code.

Flexibility and steady effort really go hand in hand.

Being open boosts my skills, so I’ll question more and listen.

That’s how real growth starts, by staying curious and receptive.
