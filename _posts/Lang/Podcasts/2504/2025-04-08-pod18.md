## Summarization 👀
Our perception of time isn’t just a mental process—it’s deeply connected to the body, especially the heartbeat.
Cognitive neuroscientist Irena Arslanova explains that time can feel faster or slower depending on our emotions, focus, or bodily state.
Her research shows that the brain doesn’t work in isolation but is influenced by signals from the body.
One key internal signal is the heartbeat, which sends rhythmic information to the brain.
During each heartbeat, when the heart contracts, the brain enters a more action-oriented state; between beats, it becomes more perceptive.

In a lab study, stimuli shown during a heartbeat were perceived as shorter in duration than those shown between beats.
This suggests our sense of time expands and contracts within each heartbeat.
Time may contract when we’re ready to act and expand when we’re focused on perception.
These findings imply that time perception is a dynamic, embodied experience shaped by the heart-brain connection.
By tuning into our bodily state—like slowing our heart through deep breathing—we might even learn to stretch meaningful moments.
