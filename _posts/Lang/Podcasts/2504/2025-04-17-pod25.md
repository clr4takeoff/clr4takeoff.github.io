## Summarization üëÄ
Before buying a home, consider whether it fits your current lifestyle and if you're ready to stay in one place for at least five years. Homeownership can offer stability and help build long-term wealth, but it's not right for everyone. To know if you can afford a home, review your credit score, income, and debt, as these affect your mortgage eligibility. You don't necessarily need a 20% down payment‚Äîsome loans allow as little as 3%, but closing costs can also add up significantly. There are various mortgage types including conventional, FHA, VA, and USDA loans, each with different benefits, especially for first-time buyers. Many states also offer programs that provide down payment or closing cost assistance. When house hunting, be prepared to view multiple homes and work with a real estate agent you trust. Always schedule a home inspection after your offer is accepted to uncover any major issues. Remember to budget for maintenance, which can average about 1% of your home's value per year. While owning a home can bring a sense of stability and financial growth, renting can still be the better option for some depending on their needs and goals.
