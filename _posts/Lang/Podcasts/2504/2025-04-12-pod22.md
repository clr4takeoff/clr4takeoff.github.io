## Summarization üëÄ
Taylor Lynn Carpenter explains that parkour is not just an extreme sport but a practical movement skill for everyone.

She started parkour at 21 to rebuild her strength and confidence after an injury.

Parkour helps people reconnect with natural movements like jumping, climbing, and balancing that many did as children.

It improves functional fitness, making daily activities like squatting, reaching, or getting up from the floor easier and safer.

Basic parkour skills, such as landing, rolling, vaulting, and climbing, can help prevent injuries and build body awareness.

The focus of parkour is not on reckless risk-taking but on respecting and understanding your body‚Äôs limits.

Parkour also builds mental resilience by encouraging people to view obstacles as challenges to overcome, not avoid.

For Carpenter, parkour transformed how she navigates urban environments, reducing stress and sparking creativity in movement.

Ordinary objects like benches, walls, and trees become opportunities for play and exploration.

Ultimately, parkour is for everyone, helping people move better, feel more confident, and rediscover joy in overcoming obstacles.
