## Summarization üëÄ
Severe flash flooding in Texas Hill Country during the July 4th weekend killed over 100 people after an unprecedented amount of rain fell in a short period. Lorena Guillen, who owns an RV park along the Guadalupe River, described waking up to floodwaters overtaking her property and witnessing desperate rescue attempts as families were swept away. Despite forecasts from the National Weather Service (NWS), questions have emerged about whether emergency warnings reached local officials and residents in time. Kerr County officials say they were notified late, and staffing issues at the local NWS office, including the lack of a Warning Coordination Meteorologist, may have contributed to the communication breakdown.
Experts like Bernadette Woods Placky emphasize that weather alerts must be multi-layered‚Äîusing cell phones, sirens, and NOAA weather radios‚Äîto ensure people receive warnings, especially during overnight events. However, alert fatigue and lack of funding for robust systems remain problems. Staffing shortages at half of the 122 NWS offices nationwide, combined with broader government cuts to climate and weather services, are reducing community preparedness. Climate change is making storms more intense and unpredictable, outpacing the infrastructure designed for past weather conditions. Placky stresses the importance of local relationships, trust, and education to help communities respond effectively. Ultimately, preparedness must evolve alongside climate risks to reduce loss of life in future disasters.
