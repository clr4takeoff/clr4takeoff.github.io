## Summarization üëÄ
Sarah Crawford-Bohl, a healthcare executive, shares why speaking up during uncomfortable situations is difficult but necessary. She explains that silence can sometimes feel safer, even when speaking out is the right thing to do. Research shows many people would rather leave their jobs than face challenging conversations, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare where communication is vital.
Crawford-Bohl uses the metaphor of a moral compass, inspired by her late mother, to guide her through difficult moments. She associates the four directions with core values: North for doing the right thing, South for offering support, East for showing empathy, and West for fostering wonder and curiosity.
She recounts a personal story where she chose to speak up when criticized publicly at work, using empathy and curiosity to turn a confrontational moment into a constructive conversation. Over time, she says, speaking up gets easier with practice, much like exercise strengthens the body.
Ultimately, Crawford-Bohl urges listeners to find their voice, even when it‚Äôs hard. She emphasizes that courageous conversations can lead to stronger relationships, greater job satisfaction, and meaningful change. By following our internal compass, we can advocate for ourselves and others, making a positive impact in our communities.
