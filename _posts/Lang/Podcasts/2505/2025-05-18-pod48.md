## Sentences ‚úçÔ∏è

1. Over the next 30 years, we're going to need to build 42 billion solar panels, 1.3 million wind turbines, 476 nuclear reactors, establish a hydrogen economy, **overhaul** our electrical grid, and transform our transportation networks.
   - `overhaul`: to completely renovate, repair, or revise something to make it work better
   - New sentence: To create a just society, we have to overhaul the systems that allow injustice to continue.


2. I started as a policy advocate and activist, **lobbying for** stronger policy interventions, and later as a scientist and an engineer, only to come to the conclusion that those industries, while very important, move so slowly.
   - `lobby for`: to try to influence decision-makers to support a specific cause or proposal
   - New sentence: The group is lobbying for stricter environmental regulations.


3. So I made my switch to the business sector, where we have both the resources and the **agility** to affect climate change on the necessary time scales.
   - `agility`: the ability to move quickly and easily; adaptability and speed in responding to change
   - New sentence: We need agility to adapt to a fast-changing world.

## Summarization üëÄ
Marielle Remillard emphasizes that reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is not just a matter of policy or innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs a massive logistical and material challenge. Building enough solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear reactors, and updating infrastructure will require enormous quantities of raw materials.
She highlights that current supply chains are not prepared for this surge in demand. Many materials, including rare earth elements, aluminum, carbon fiber, and even boron, could face critical shortages through 2030. Even design choices in technologies can significantly impact material scarcity.
Substituting materials to overcome shortages can create new bottlenecks. For example, replacing carbon fiber with fiberglass could strain boron supplies, which are geographically limited and slow to scale. The situation is complex and interconnected across industries.
Yet, within this challenge lies enormous economic opportunity. Companies that adapt‚Äîwhether in manufacturing, logistics, or even finance‚Äîcan thrive in this emerging transition economy. Remillard urges business leaders to innovate and invest thoughtfully, balancing environmental impact with smart growth.
Achieving net zero will be difficult, but with coordinated public and private efforts, it also offers the biggest industrial growth opportunity since the Industrial Revolution.
