## Summarization 👀
An early and intense heat wave has struck India and Pakistan, with temperatures reaching up to 49°C (120°F), far above seasonal averages. This extreme heat is affecting hundreds of millions of people, putting strain on energy systems, agriculture, and public health. Schools have closed, trains have stopped, and power outages are common as electricity demand skyrockets. Climate experts warn that by 2050, some regions in South Asia may reach temperatures beyond human survivability.

In the midst of this crisis, locals are turning to traditional cooling methods, like scarves, umbrellas, and finding shade, though these are only temporary solutions. The situation raises concern about what the coming summer months of May, June, and July will bring.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., Barnes & Noble is experiencing a comeback after years of decline. The bookstore chain has focused on selling actual books, curating local selections, and creating welcoming, social spaces. CEO James Daunt explains that readers—especially younger ones—are embracing both trendy fiction and timeless classics.

Finally, scientists have created the first-ever 3D map of a mammal’s brain, using a mouse that watched The Matrix while running on a treadmill. The resulting map revealed the structure and function of 84,000 neurons and half a billion synapses in a speck of brain the size of a grain of sand.
