## Summarization üëÄ
Adam Munder, a deaf engineer and entrepreneur, shares the daily challenges faced by millions of deaf individuals due to communication barriers in a hearing-centered world. Even simple tasks like ordering coffee or going to the doctor can become isolating and frustrating without proper interpretation support.

Adam recalls a painful experience when a doctor asked his 7-year-old daughter to interpret during a medical visit. He explains how he constantly shifts between two worlds: one where he manages family, real estate, and small business interactions with minimal communication tools, and another in his professional life where he relies heavily on qualified interpreters to compete equally.

However, interpreters are expensive and scarce‚Äîespecially in places like Arizona, where over a million people with hearing loss are served by only around 400 licensed interpreters. This scarcity forces many into "survival mode" communication using text or pen and paper, which lacks the nuance of American Sign Language (ASL).

To solve this, Adam created OmniBridge, an AI-powered platform that translates ASL into English in real time. By using advanced computing on AI PCs, the tool runs locally and increases accessibility without internet reliance.

Adam emphasizes that this innovation isn‚Äôt just about convenience‚Äîit‚Äôs about restoring dignity, improving access, and building true human connection between the deaf and hearing communities. Through AI, OmniBridge is helping to level the playing field and redefine inclusion in communication.
