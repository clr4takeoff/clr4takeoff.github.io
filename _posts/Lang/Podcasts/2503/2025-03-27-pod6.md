## Summarization üëÄ
In this episode, Miro Kazakoff from MIT Sloan discusses how to use data effectively for persuasive communication. He emphasizes that while data may be objective, people are not‚Äîso understanding your audience‚Äôs decision-making process is essential. Rather than overwhelming people with numbers, communicators should present data clearly and visually, focusing on comparisons and simplicity. He warns against the "curse of knowledge," where experts forget what it‚Äôs like to not understand something. To overcome this, it's important to guide the audience through every element of a chart or slide. Kazakoff highlights that storytelling is powerful, but only when grounded in solid logic and accurate data. He stresses the importance of using empathy and curiosity to connect with the audience. Context should be timely and relevant, not overloaded at the beginning. His core advice: assume your audience sees things differently, know who they are, and structure your message clearly.
