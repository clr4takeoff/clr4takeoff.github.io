## Summarization üëÄ
Many adults never learned to swim and feel embarrassed or ashamed, which can become a barrier to trying. Olympic swimmer Cullen Jones, who nearly drowned as a child, encourages adults to overcome that fear and learn.
He emphasizes that swimming isn‚Äôt just a sport‚Äîit‚Äôs a life-saving skill, especially important since 11 people drown every day in the U.S. The American Red Cross says only 56% of Americans can perform basic survival swimming skills, despite 85% claiming they can swim.
Adults learning to swim should find an instructor they connect with, and many local pools or programs, like those found at usaswimming.org/makeasplash, offer affordable or free lessons.
Mental barriers, like shame or fear of looking silly, are common but shouldn‚Äôt stop people. Preparation‚Äîlike packing your bag the night before‚Äîcan make it easier to show up for lessons.
Freestyle is usually the first stroke taught because it‚Äôs relatively easy to learn and breathe through. Learning to tread water and float, especially through techniques like sculling, is crucial for staying above water.
The five essential water safety skills include safely submerging, floating or treading water for a minute, turning to find an exit, swimming 25 yards, and exiting the water without a ladder.
Lastly, Jones urges people not to fear failure‚Äîlearning to swim takes time and courage, but it's worth it for safety, health, and peace of mind.
