## Summarization üëÄ
Conflict is a natural and unavoidable part of life, whether in personal relationships or global politics. In her 2024 TED Talk, Darya Shaikh suggests that instead of avoiding or "winning" conflicts, we should learn from them to spark growth, creativity, and even hope.

Drawing from her experience in peacebuilding and corporate strategy, she introduces a tool called Three Horizons, which helps navigate change. Horizon 1 represents the current system‚Äîstable but often outdated. Horizon 3 is the visionary future we strive toward. Horizon 2 bridges the two, where innovation and experimentation occur.

Each horizon reflects a different voice: Horizon 1 is the manager keeping things running, Horizon 3 is the dreamer pushing for bold change, and Horizon 2 is the entrepreneur trying to build new solutions. While these voices often clash, Shaikh emphasizes that all are necessary to move forward.

She shares an example from a company merger where she used this model to help leaders imagine a shared future and identify current obstacles. The result was a renewed sense of purpose and cooperation.

Shaikh concludes by saying that while we don‚Äôt need to agree on everything, how we engage in conflict matters. Better conflicts‚Äîrooted in respect and shared vision‚Äîcan unlock transformation we never thought possible.
