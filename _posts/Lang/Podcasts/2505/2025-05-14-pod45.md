## Summarization üëÄ
Linguist Adam Aleksic explores how social media platforms‚Äîespecially TikTok‚Äîare transforming the way we use language. Words like unalive, which originated as euphemisms to avoid content moderation filters, have now entered everyday vocabulary among young people, even appearing in school essays and classroom discussions. Most users don‚Äôt realize these terms were invented as workarounds for algorithmic censorship; they simply adopt them from online communities. Aleksic explains that this is part of a larger pattern where social media algorithms shape not only which words spread, but how fast and widely they do. Viral content like the Rizzler song helps boost slang such as rizz, gyat, and skibbity by attaching them to catchy trends, reinforcing their popularity through repetition and engagement.
These platforms also commercialize identity through trending words like cottagecore, encouraging users to associate with niche aesthetics and consume related content. Even slang patterns like the -pilled suffix have been co-opted from harmful subcultures, with origins in incel rhetoric, raising concerns about algorithm-driven exposure to extremist ideas. At the same time, Aleksic highlights how much of modern slang originates from Black and queer communities, but once these words go viral, they often lose their cultural context and are commodified by broader internet culture. While this pattern of appropriation is not new, algorithms now accelerate it significantly.
Despite the risks, Aleksic doesn‚Äôt believe language is being destroyed. He sees today‚Äôs slang as a reflection of creativity, humor, and social identity, much like previous generations‚Äô use of words like cool or hi-fi. What‚Äôs important, he argues, is being aware‚Äîaware of how algorithms influence our speech, how marketing shapes our identities, and how certain words can perpetuate harm. Understanding where words come from, and how they function in society, helps us better understand ourselves. And with that, he closes with the perfect piece of modern slang: ‚ÄúThanks for coming to my TED Talk.‚Äù
