## Summarization üëÄ
Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, a Harvard physician, introduces "The 5 Resets" ‚Äî a roadmap for recovering from chronic stress.

The first reset is finding your M.O.S.T. goal: M for motivating, O for objective and measurable, S for small, and T for timely.

The second reset is setting boundaries with technology by limiting phone use to 20 minutes a day and keeping devices out of reach, especially in the morning and at night.

The third reset focuses on strengthening the mind-body connection through daily movement and simple breathing exercises like "Stop, Breathe, Be."

The fourth reset encourages single-tasking instead of multitasking, using time-blocking methods and taking regular short breaks to recharge.

The fifth reset is practicing daily gratitude journaling ‚Äî writing down five things you‚Äôre thankful for every night to reframe negative thoughts and quiet the inner critic.

These small changes help lower stress hormones, improve immune function, and reduce the risk of diseases like heart problems and high blood pressure.

Dr. Nerurkar emphasizes the "Resilience Rule of Two," advising people to start with just two new habits at a time to avoid overwhelming the brain.

Once those habits stick, you can add two more, building sustainable change over time.

Ultimately, the goal is to work with your biology, not against it, to create a healthier, less stressful life.
