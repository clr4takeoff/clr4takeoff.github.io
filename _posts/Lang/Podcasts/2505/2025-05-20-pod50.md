## Summarization üëÄ
Creativity is not a fixed trait but a choice and skill anyone can grow. Psychologist Zorana Ivcevic Pringle explains that believing we‚Äôre ‚Äúnot creative‚Äù often prevents us from trying in the first place.
Creativity exists in many forms‚Äîfrom ‚Äúmini C‚Äù (personal learning) to ‚Äúlittle C‚Äù (everyday creativity), ‚Äúpro C‚Äù (professional innovation), and ‚Äúbig C‚Äù (culturally impactful genius). Recognizing these levels helps build creative confidence.
One way to grow creativity is by observing others we identify with and starting small projects to build momentum. Taking inspiration from everyday life and gradually building creative habits can help you develop belief in your abilities.
Contrary to popular belief, creativity often thrives under constraints, which help push original thinking beyond clich√©s. For example, limiting your tools or focusing on specific memories can lead to more meaningful ideas.
If you hit a creative block, step back, reframe the problem, or treat yourself with compassion as you would a friend. Progress comes from taking action, staying curious, and giving yourself permission to explore creatively‚Äîone small step at a time.
