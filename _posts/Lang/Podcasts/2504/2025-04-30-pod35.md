## Summarization üëÄ
In times of economic uncertainty and tariff changes, it's important to limit exposure to overwhelming news and avoid information overload. Taking breaks from news and social media can help protect your mental well-being.
Be cautious of financial scams, especially during volatile periods when misinformation is common. Verify credentials before sending money or trusting financial advice.
Building an emergency fund is crucial‚Äîaim for at least 6 months of expenses, and use a high-yield savings account that's separate from your main bank to avoid temptation. If you‚Äôre still building your savings, consider lowering debt payments temporarily while continuing to pay at least the minimum.
If you're within 5 years of retirement, consult a fee-only certified financial planner to ensure your portfolio is balanced. For younger investors, stay focused on long-term goals and avoid panic selling during market dips.
Don't rush to buy items out of fear that tariffs will raise prices. Instead, make thoughtful decisions based on real needs and your current financial situation.
