## Summarization üëÄ
Maintaining old friendships takes effort, and it‚Äôs important to recognize that people express care in different ways. When a friend goes quiet or seems less responsive, assume the best‚Äîchances are, it‚Äôs not personal. Life gets busy, but friendships can stay strong through small gestures like scheduled calls, voice memos, or even handwritten letters. Catching up doesn‚Äôt have to mean a full life update; just dive into what‚Äôs most present in your life right now.
Long-term friendships thrive when we stop keeping score and learn to give each other the benefit of the doubt. Understanding that people have different communication styles and organizational habits can help ease frustration. Face-to-face time, even if occasional, is valuable‚Äîchanging the communication ‚Äúvenue‚Äù can reinvigorate the connection. It‚Äôs also crucial to give friends the space to grow and change, rather than holding them to who they used to be.
If something is bothering you, bring it up with kindness and curiosity, not accusation. Ultimately, strong friendships are built on effort, empathy, and the grace to let each other evolve.
