## Summarization üëÄ
Cartoonist Navied Mahdavian reflects on how art, particularly cartooning, helped him process grief after the death of his grandmother, Homa. As someone who understands the world visually, he felt an urgent need to draw her hands when he learned she was dying.
His work had long been impersonal, but the birth of his daughter marked a shift toward more personal storytelling. Through cartooning, he learned to distill big emotions‚Äîlike grief‚Äîinto simple, expressive lines. He explains the phenomenon of face pareidolia, how we project ourselves onto cartoon faces, and how that opens space for shared human emotion.
Mahdavian didn‚Äôt get to draw his grandmother‚Äôs hands before she passed, so he used his own as a model, imagining them aged and frail. Drawing became a way to preserve the physical sensation and emotional memory of her. He emphasizes that grief can be shallow when we reduce loved ones to caricatures; instead, he tries to capture their full complexity.
By inhabiting others through his art‚Äîhis grandmother, father, daughter‚Äîhe reaches deeper empathy and understanding. Ultimately, Mahdavian argues that communication through art transcends words, helping us feel seen, connected, and less alone in our loss.
