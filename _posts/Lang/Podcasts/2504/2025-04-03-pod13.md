## Summarization üëÄ
Laura Miele, president at Electronic Arts, highlights how gaming has evolved into a powerful tool for human connection. Beyond improved graphics, games have become central to pop culture and major social events, with The Game Awards attracting more viewers than the Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys combined. She emphasizes that gaming isn't just entertainment‚Äîit's a platform for collaboration, creativity, and emotional connection.

In an age of artificial intelligence and digital isolation, gaming offers real human interaction. Research shows that many people play games to avoid loneliness, and playing with a small group‚Äîan "atomic network" of 3‚Äì5 friends‚Äîdeepens connection. Miele shares personal experiences of bonding with her family through games like World of Warcraft.

Studies suggest people who game together tend to be more collaborative in real life. AI and new technologies like immersive headsets will only enhance the social potential of gaming. Despite the rise of social media, people feel lonelier than ever‚Äîgaming could be the cure.

Miele encourages us to stop scrolling and start playing to build meaningful relationships. She believes games are the superior social platform of the future. Ultimately, she‚Äôs optimistic that games can unite us and help us thrive together in a digital age.
