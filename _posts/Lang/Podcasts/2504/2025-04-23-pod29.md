## Summarization üëÄ
A powerful solar storm recently dazzled the skies with bright auroras visible much farther south than usual. Originally predicted to reach a G3 level, the storm intensified to a severe G4 level, briefly disrupting power grids, satellites, and communications. These effects came from solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) sent by the sun, which is becoming more active as it approaches its solar maximum‚Äîthe peak of its 11-year activity cycle.
Meanwhile, deep in the ocean, scientists have captured the first-ever footage of a colossal squid in its natural habitat. This mysterious deep-sea creature, which can grow over 20 feet long and has eyes the size of basketballs, has fascinated researchers for over a century. The expedition also revealed other rare marine species, like Galatuthis glacialis, highlighting the delicate beauty and diversity of life in the deep sea.
Back on land, the city of Osaka in Japan is preparing to host its second World Expo. The event will welcome over 150 countries and 28 million visitors, showcasing futuristic ideas and global collaboration. Despite challenges such as construction delays and slow ticket sales, many hope the Expo will revitalize Japan‚Äôs economy and deliver a message of unity in uncertain times.
In China, engineers have completed the Huajang Grand Canyon Bridge, the tallest bridge in the world, standing at a jaw-dropping 2,051 feet. The bridge will cut travel time across the canyon from two hours to just one minute.
