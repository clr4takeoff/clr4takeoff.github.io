## Summarization üëÄ
Air-traffic chaos at Newark Liberty began on April 28 when controllers briefly lost both radio contact and radar visibility, forcing pilots into ‚Äúradio silence‚Äù and triggering massive delays and cancellations. Five traumatized controllers later took 45 days of leave, highlighting the intense stress such incidents cause when aircraft converge at 200 mph with no surveillance. Investigators traced the outage to decades-old copper wiring linking a New York facility to Newark‚Äôs approach tower, emblematic of antiquated equipment‚Äîsome from the 1970s‚Äîthat still underpins the national air-traffic system. The outage was not isolated: similar brief blackouts have recurred, and the FAA now faces a controller shortage exceeding 3,000 after pandemic-era hiring freezes and retirements compounded staffing gaps. Despite the headlines, experts insist U.S. commercial aviation remains far safer than driving, noting the FAA will reduce traffic volume before compromising safety.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled an ambitious three-to-four-year plan to ‚Äúrip out and replace‚Äù the system: 25,000 new radios, 475 voice switches, fiber-optic telecom, and full tower upgrades. The overhaul is expected to cost ‚Äútens of billions‚Äù and still needs congressional approval, making bipartisan cooperation crucial. In the meantime, travelers may face more delays as the FAA throttles flights to maintain safety while patching aging infrastructure. Real-ID rules that took effect Wednesday add another wrinkle: passengers with non-compliant licenses can still fly but should expect extra screening until they upgrade. Industry leaders, airlines, and lawmakers agree the modernization can‚Äôt wait decades, yet Friday‚Äôs repeat outage near Newark underscores how urgent‚Äîand politically complex‚Äîthe fix really is.
