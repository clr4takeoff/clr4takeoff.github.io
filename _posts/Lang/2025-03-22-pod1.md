## 1-min Speech Script 🗣️

I enjoyed this podcast a lot, and it made me rethink team project struggles.

It reminded me that collaboration is more about mindset than just skill.

Debugging isn’t my **strong suit**, so I often miss bugs.

That used to frustrate me, but now I see it as part of the learning process.

That’s where intellectual humility helps, especially since we don’t **see eye to eye** on team projects, which turn messy.

Accepting that others think differently has actually made things smoother.

Tech **jargon** confuses me too, but I shouldn’t **derogate** others’ ideas.

Hard work **culminates** in better results, while rigidity ruins good code.

Flexibility and steady effort really go hand in hand.

Being open boosts my skills, so I’ll question more and listen.

That’s how real growth starts, by staying curious and receptive.
