## Summarization üëÄ

Chris Duffy hosts Rick Weissbourd on How to Be a Better Human to discuss cultivating kindness and morality. 
Duffy shares a funny memory of working with Weissbourd on videos sparking ethical talks among kids, like Pierce‚Äôs tale of sneaking his parents‚Äô phone. Weissbourd, a Harvard professor, revisits his 2009 book, noting stagnant progress in connecting parents and engaging fathers. 
He highlights a parental mental health crisis mirroring teen struggles, worsened by isolation. 
They explore how shame, unlike guilt, reflects self-image more than a child‚Äôs actions, urging support to ease it. 

Weissbourd critiques hyper-individualism and the focus on happiness over morality, advocating for collective well-being. He challenges the obsession with elite colleges, recalling his son Jake‚Äôs pushback against community pressures. 
Practical tips include prioritizing kindness in parenting and knowing kids deeply rather than over-praising. 
He calls for restoring morality in education and public life, beyond self-esteem or achievement. The episode ends with a plea to share these ideas for moral reflection.
