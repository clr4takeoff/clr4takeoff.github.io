2. And that satellite would need **spectrometers** that did not yet exist.
    - `spectrometer`: A scientific instrument used to measure and analyze the properties of light, especially to determine the composition of substances.
    - New sentence: The researchers used a spectrometer to analyze the chemical makeup of the distant star‚Äôs atmosphere.

 
3. We are supporting both the technology and the **advocacy**.

## Summarization üëÄ
Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, responsible for about 12% of U.S. emissions, mainly from livestock, landfills, and leaky oil and gas infrastructure. Despite its relatively short atmospheric lifespan, methane traps over 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide in the short term.

To tackle this urgent issue, the Environmental Defense Fund launched MethaneSAT, a satellite designed to detect and track global methane emissions with high precision. Traditional self-reporting and airplane-based detection methods were limited, prompting the need for space-based monitoring.

MethaneSAT uses innovative spectrometers to measure methane levels from 590 km above the Earth, capturing both large leaks and smaller, dispersed sources. The satellite collects comprehensive data and shares it freely with governments, companies, and nonprofits.

Fixing methane leaks is often technically simple but lacks prioritization‚ÄîMethaneSAT aims to change that by providing accurate, timely data. The goal is to cut methane emissions from oil and gas by 75% within six years.

Over 150 countries have joined the Global Methane Pledge, and companies covering 40% of global production have committed to reduce methane emissions by 90% by 2030. With transparency, data, and coordinated action, we can slow global warming in our lifetimes.
