## Summarization üëÄ
Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, a pioneering anthropologist and primatologist, explores the intersection of AI and parenting in a TED Talk guest-curated by Kelly Corrigan. Known for her work on alloparents‚Äînon-maternal caregivers‚ÄîHrdy emphasizes that human babies evolved in communities with shared caregiving, not solely maternal care.
She explains that our slow-developing, high-maintenance infants required extensive social support to survive. As a result, humans developed strong neural mechanisms for empathy, trust, and cooperation‚Äîtraits rooted in early life experiences of care from multiple adults.
In today‚Äôs world, with fewer alloparents and increasing reliance on devices, Hrdy questions whether robots could take on caregiving roles. While AI may respond faster and more consistently than distracted parents, she warns this could reshape our species‚Äô core social instincts.
Hrdy stresses that babies bond with those who respond to them, regardless of whether the responder is human or machine. This raises the unsettling question: if AI can form attachments with children, should it?
While some technologists see AI as a solution, Hrdy remains cautious, highlighting that our "other-regarding" nature‚Äîour deep concern for others‚Äîis not guaranteed to persist. She sees this trait as humanity‚Äôs defining strength, but also as something vulnerable to change.
Ultimately, Hrdy suggests that true caregiving‚Äîrooted in emotional understanding and human connection‚Äîcannot be easily replicated by machines. If we delegate this role to AI, we may unintentionally change what it means to be human.
