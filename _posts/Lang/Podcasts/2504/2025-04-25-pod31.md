## Summarization üëÄ
Text has long been the foundation of how we communicate, from books to status updates, but Victor Riparbelli, CEO of Synthesia, suggests that we are now entering a new era where video and audio‚Äîdriven by AI‚Äîbecome our primary modes of expression. Although he personally loves reading, Riparbelli believes that future generations may view reading and writing as outdated, much like we now see hieroglyphs or papyrus scrolls. He argues that while text is efficient, it's an imperfect tool that strips away emotional nuance, tone, and body language‚Äîall of which are naturally present in voice and video. The rapid growth of platforms like TikTok and YouTube reveals our preference for richer, more intuitive ways to learn and connect. AI will soon enable anyone to create high-quality video content without expensive equipment or expertise, making immersive media as accessible as typing a message. With tools like digital avatars and intelligent assistants, learning and storytelling will become highly personalized and interactive. A recent study even shows that 77% of people prefer learning through AI-generated video rather than text. As this technology blends into education, work, and entertainment, we may soon experience content that is dynamic, adaptive, and continuous‚Äîmuch like a never-ending story tailored just for us. Ultimately, Riparbelli challenges us to rethink our attachment to the written word and consider how we want to shape this AI-powered future. It's not just about whether content is real or artificial‚Äîit's about how we choose to engage with a world where the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurred.
