## Summarization üëÄ
President Trump has launched a massive new tariff policy, calling it "Liberation Day," aiming to correct what he sees as decades of unfair trade practices against the U.S. This move has shaken global markets, causing stock prices to plummet and raising fears of a possible recession.

The administration's strategy is based on reducing trade deficits and bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., even though most economists doubt its effectiveness. Trump's economic advisors believe their past experience with tariffs proves their approach can work, despite global skepticism.

Industries like steel and auto manufacturing support these tariffs, hoping for more domestic production. However, supply chains are complex, and many U.S.-made products still rely heavily on foreign parts, making the plan difficult to implement without price increases.

While CEOs and investors express concern, Trump seems determined to follow through, focusing less on market reactions than during his first term. The uncertainty surrounding these policies is expected to continue, affecting businesses, consumers, and global trade relationships in unpredictable ways.
