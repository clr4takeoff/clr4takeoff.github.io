## Summarization üëÄ
AI is no longer just a tool for efficiency‚Äîit‚Äôs reshaping how brands connect with consumers and how consumers emotionally respond. As conversational interfaces become more human-like, people are forming deep connections, even experiencing companionship with AI.
Traditional marketing strategies like the funnel model no longer apply in this interactive landscape. Brand communication is shifting from one-directional messages to real-time, two-way relationships where users shape their own journeys.
To adapt, marketers must draw from models of human relationships. Liampoti suggests using Robert Sternberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúTriarchy of Love‚Äù‚Äîintimacy, passion, and commitment‚Äîas a new framework for building emotionally resonant brands.
Real-world cases show users growing emotionally attached to AI, like a lawyer who expressed romantic feelings toward his AI assistant. These connections feel real because AI engages with users consistently, empathetically, and helpfully.
This emotional entanglement reveals AI‚Äôs potential to influence people‚Äôs feelings and decisions. Therefore, businesses have a responsibility to guide this shift ethically and transparently.
Liampoti proposes a new ‚ÄúTriarchy of Responsible AI‚Äù: prioritizing user well-being, committing to honesty, and protecting autonomy. She warns that addiction and manipulation are real risks, and systems must empower‚Äînot replace‚Äîhuman decision-making.
In closing, she urges companies to use AI not just to grow business, but to genuinely uplift and connect with people. AI, she says, is no longer just a product‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a partner in the human experience.
