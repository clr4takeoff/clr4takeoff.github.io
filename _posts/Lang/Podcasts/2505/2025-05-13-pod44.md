## Summarization üëÄ
Beth Moncel, founder of Budget Bytes, shares tips on saving money by calculating the cost per serving of meals. This approach helps reveal which ingredients are driving up food costs and encourages smarter meal planning.
To save money, reduce expensive ingredients like meat, cheese, and nuts by using them in smaller portions and replacing some with cheaper, filling options like beans, lentils, cabbage, and rice.
Planning is key: make a meal plan based on what you already have, and check local sales before shopping. Apps like Flipp help track store deals and can guide recipe choices.
Shopping with a list and avoiding peak hours reduces stress and impulse buys. Pre-checking items and prices online also makes grocery trips more efficient.
Freezers are great for preserving leftover ingredients, but keeping an inventory list helps avoid forgetting what‚Äôs inside.
Bulk buying isn‚Äôt always cheaper‚Äîcompare prices and consider storage and usage before purchasing large quantities.
For grocery deliveries, choose services with good communication about substitutions to keep your meal plan on track.
If food costs are still too high, food banks can help bridge the gap, even if you only need a few items.
Start small with meal planning to avoid burnout and track your savings to stay motivated. Cooking can become enjoyable over time, especially when shared with loved ones.
And remember, saving money starts with small changes and builds with consistent habits.
