## Summarization üëÄ
Strength training helps build muscle, but protein intake is essential to see real gains. Traditionally, animal protein was seen as superior because it contains all essential amino acids in the right proportions for muscle growth.
Plant proteins are sometimes lower in certain amino acids like lysine or methionine, which led to the belief they were inferior for muscle building. However, recent research shows that with a variety of plant-based foods, people can get all essential amino acids and build muscle just as effectively.
One study from the University of Illinois found no difference in muscle growth between vegan and omnivore participants when both groups ate the same amount of protein. The key is eating a diverse range of plant-based proteins‚Äîlike beans, tofu, quinoa, peas, and rice‚Äîto cover all amino acid needs.
Even protein timing (eating throughout the day vs. in one big meal) didn‚Äôt affect muscle gains significantly. Plant-based protein powders made from mixed sources (like pea and rice) can help ensure complete amino acid intake.
Experts suggest aiming for 1.2‚Äì1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight if you're actively training. Overall, a well-balanced vegan diet can support strong, healthy muscle growth without relying on meat.
